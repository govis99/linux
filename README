# CMPE283 Assignment 1

1. For each member in your team, provide 1 paragraph detailing what parts of the lab that member 
implemented / researched. (You may skip this question if you are doing the lab by yourself).

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
